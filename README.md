> ### Laravel Livewire codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://realworld.sawirstudio.com)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Github](https://github.com/sawirricardo/realworld-tall-app)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Laravel Livewire** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Laravel Livewire** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
